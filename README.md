Welcome, young developer! You are reading the official readme of **The LaSallian's** GitHub organization page. This is handled by their Web Development team and provides a look into the sites and projects that were and currently are in development.

## Why GitHub?
**The LaSallian's** Web Development team is an advocate for open-source projects. Using platforms like GitHub gives their developers a chance to not only strut their skills in Git and version control, but also to know what it truly means to work in a collaborative environmentâ€”both inside or outside of the organization.
